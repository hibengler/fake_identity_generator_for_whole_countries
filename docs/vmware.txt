In order to get money incorporated into the system,
We need vmware for kcd.com, jingservice.com, and dev.kcd.com

So the best way is to interface witht he existing hard drives.
Here is how to do it:

1. plug in the hard drives
2. check out the file systems



mdadm --stop /dev/md124
mdadm --stop /dev/md125
mdadm --stop /dev/md126
mdadm --stop /dev/md127

# obviously sde would be here too
mdadm -A /dev/md2 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1
mdadm -A /dev/md3 /dev/sdd2 /dev/sde2
mdadm -A /dev/md4 /dev/sdd3 /dev/sde3
mdadm -A /dev/md5 /dev/sdd4 /dev/sde4

# this section is for our ernie dev 
mdadm -A /dev/md2 --run /dev/sdd1
mdadm -A /dev/md3 --run /dev/sdd2
mdadm -A /dev/md4 --run /dev/sdd3
mdadm -A /dev/md5 --run /dev/sdd4


cd /etc/mdadm
mdadm --detail --scan >mdadm.conf
update-initramfs -u


Then reboot to check
Then add u... to /etc/fstab

fsck /dev/md2
# md3 is swap
fsck /dev/md3
fsck /dev/md4
fsck /dev/md5

mkdir /ernie

mount /dev/md2 /ernie
mount /dev/md4 /ernie/b
mount /dev/md5 /ernie/u


OK - so we are getting vmware-player-4.0.4
cd ~/install/vmware64
Needed patched and apt-get install patch but works.


vmplayer - the name


/etc/vmnet/networking sets the networks
