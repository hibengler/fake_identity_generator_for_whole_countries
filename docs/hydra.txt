hydra - multi snaked output.
Split into about 600k items (about 400 of them) and have each one listed in idsoandso.txt
husbands and wives are kept together.


600000 is less than 28*28*28*28
so that is what we are going to have - 
For each set we get 28 random nouns - done 4 ways.
and the deeper one goes, the better it gets.

There will be 44,000 entries - I will get it from the english dictonary randomized
and use that to build the hydra program.

That gets a number, which we add to the base number.

Then the number should get us another number, and we can look up 
that number by id?
The numebrs in ascii have 11 characters, in 64 bit they have 8 - so the filename is 
ok,
