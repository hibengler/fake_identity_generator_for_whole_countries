Reconfigure using fdisk

I make a dummy first record so that the boudnary is aligned to 65535 -
that way both partitions should be aligned and read and write quickly.  

then zero out the new partitions

cp /dev/null /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf


dpkg-reconfigure mdadm - fix boot degraded crap
then reboot


then tell the boot about the change:
update-initramfs -u

then halt and turn off the fucking machine (latent cache or something)

Then turn it back on


OK now we should be ok
with NO files under /proc/mdstat



mdadm /dev/md0 --create --auto yes -l 0 -n 3 /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdc2
mdadm /dev/md1 --create --auto yes -l 0 -n 3 /dev/sda4 /dev/sdb3 /dev/sdc3
mkfs -t ext4 -j /dev/md1





cd /etc/mdadm
mdadm --detail --scan >mdadm.conf

Then change to md1 and md0



then
update-initramfs -u

then:
reboot


Then reboot to check
Then add u1 to /etc/fstab
then reboot again







OH yeah
cd /etc/default
me grub
uncomment:
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"

then:
update-grub
