<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h1>General</h1>
There are two ways to program computers, one way is to write one's own code, and the other way is to 
integrate with pre-written code.  For this project,  I bended towards the former.
<p>
Some of the tools work well for general purpose processing of data,  especially when the data is relativily static.
<p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
The hardware used started out as an 1999 dell laptop with a pentium 3 processor 2gb ram.  I quickly progressed to using a 2009 Macbook
pro with a SSD, and 8GB ram.  Then I briefly tried an HP store-variety desktop with 8GB ram running linux.
Finally I used a home built a 6 core AMD machine with 4 2tb hard drives in a raid-0, 16GB ram.
32GB would have halved the time to process, as many of the early stages could completely be cached in ram.
<p>
<h2>Database selection:</h2>
When first starting,  I used the Oracle Database to record the information.  Unfortunately,  I found
Oracle to be way too slow to process the large amount of information.  So I then switched to mysql, primarily
using the ISAM enging.   This was 10 times faster than Oracle on my system - quite impressive.  But
it was too slow also.  In order to do the processing,  I wrote customized tools using direct file access,
usually via memory mapping.  I found that this brought the fastest and most convienent processing possuble.
Because of the large size, and because memory mapping is used,  this has to be on a 64 bit machine.  But older sempirons can run it.
<h2>Computer Language</h2>
The computer language primarily used is C,  with perl in some parts for good measure, and snobol as well.
Perl is easy to put things together to process stuff.  But although it is fast enough for usual file processing,  it is 
real slow compared to native C.  So I progressed to placing more and more tools in C.
Some of these tools,  - the generic processing ones - will probably be released as GPL.  I just need a good name for them.
<h2>File Format</h2>
<p>
The files are basically comma separated value files,   using the verticall bar (|) as the comma.
No work was done to escape the vertical bar in the data file.  So there is not record that has 
a vertical bar as part of the data.  This is similar to how the NUL character is processed on 
c based strings; it is removed from the data set.  Information is assumed to be in the Ascii character set,  a 
small subset of UTF-8, and WE8ISO8559-P1, which works fine for the given subject matter - the USA.
<p>
Files are either sorted,   are arranged in a hash table,  or are marked by a perfect hash table,
which speeds things up immensely.  The language of sorting is C - 
so there is no need for translation.
Sorting allows binary search to be used,  and range search is also possible.  Hash tables allows order(1)
for the search,  but is much more of a memory hog.
<p>
<h2>Process</h2>
The data is processed as an assembly line,  with 15 main waypoints on the conveyor belt.
Each section has it's own makefile which processes values.
