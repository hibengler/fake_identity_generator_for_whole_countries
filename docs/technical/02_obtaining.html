<h1>Obtaining the Source Material</h1>
In order to get a good idea of how to make fake identities,  one needs a set of real identities.
And this is hard to get.  whitepages.com and other directory listings does have alot of 
information,  which can be queried by street names.  However, the terms of use preclude one from 
using the data for anything besides amusement.<p>
Because generic lists cannot be comyrighted in the US,  companies have restrictive terms of use which 
is supposed to preclude one from stealing the work of others,  who have compiled the information.
I ran into the terms of use many times,  and was able to find a way to avoid violating any terms of use.
<h2> Dead end #1- mailing list companies.</h2>
These companies will sell a list of individuals for mass mailings.  It is designed to 
filter based on specific demographics,  and the mail information is cleaned up as to allow for
the bulk mail discount.  These mailings are not bought, they are leased.  The leasing means that they 
can only be used once, ad only to send mail out.  They did not have phone information.
I purchased a test city for about $300.00,   and realized pretty quickly that I could never afford 
$50,000.00 to lease the whole country,  and that getting the proper terms of use would probably bring the bill into the hundreds of thousands.
<p>
Then I found a company that was selling leads - primarily for phone call marketing.  In this case,  the data was owned,  and could be used anywhere.
This data also had phone numbers, addresses, and many other goodies,  but could not be published
based on the terms of use.   <p>
I purchased this set for about $1000.00, and described my desire to make scrambled sets of 
the data to the CEO of the company.  I eventually got written permission to use the data in that way,  and I was off and running.
<p>
To find the addresses,  I considered using the ZIP+4 database,  which is primarily used to clean up addresses 
to prepare tehm for bulk mailing.  ZIP+4 has another extension which allows one to verify if an 
address is valid.  In theory this could be used to know every address in the country.  But the
terms of use are extremely strong against that possiblity.  The ZIP+4 database can only be used
on addresses obtained "somewhere else", and cannot be used to build lists.<p>
I never used this database.
<p>
Most of the other sets of data - states, cities, etc, are all available online.  Also,   
the rules for drivers license numbering is also online,  however I think that some state's 
info is outdated.<p>
