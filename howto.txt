Fake name Generator

This is the software used to generate fake names.  It did this using a set of real names obtained legally, expanding it, adding
socual security numbers, phone numbers, drivers licenses, etc.

This powers xdd.org xdduk.org xdd2.org and other sets of fake identity information.






How to generate
cd ~/cvs/player
. ./setup
cd src
make 
cd ..
script something
export SET=SOANDSO
export OWN=SUCHANDSUCH
mkdir out
time make





... edit hc hd and he filter_me.sh scripts to add the filters of all the 
previous runs.
This is done after typing make because you have about 10 hours to get it done.

cd src
Edit make_birthdate1.c make_birthdate2.c add_birthdate_birth_state.c
make_ssn_numbers.c
(make_nuid_numbers.c make_dl_uk.c) to the current date
make


The full process takes 9 days on my 6 core cpu with 4 2tb drives 
raid 0 and 32gb ram.




cd he_extra_houses_and_people
time bash save_new.sh
cp exlfza_$SET.txt /t/exlfza
