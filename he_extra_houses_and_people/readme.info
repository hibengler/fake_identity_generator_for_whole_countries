This section doubles the number of people by making new houses based on existing houses.
Input is l006 - which is about 125 million people - expanded households with wives, uncles and aunts.



l006 - the input for this side
country.txt - a count of all people in the country from l006
house.txt - count of people per address
house_index.txt - indexed position for address without po box 
street.txt - count of people per street
zip.txt - count of people per zip code

Then make_street reads from house.txt to make the new addresses possible. to build newhouse.txt
make_street2 builds the same as make_street but it adds 2 city blocks to each block,  this is 
the second set - so we fill up the inner city first, then grow the city second.

newhouse.txt - new houses inbetween known houses
newhouse2.txt - new houses outside of known block numbers
country_a.txt - country.txt with USA added as an extra field and the desired number of people to make.
                 This is then distributed by zip, etc.
zip_a.txt - zip code old count and new count

address_lname_gender_id.txt: used to match husband and spouse - done zip code by zip code.
      zip|addr|last name|gender|id|count

newhouse_zipcount.txt   - number of houses in the zip code of new houses between existing houses
newhouse2_zipcount.txt  - number of houses in the zip code of potential new houses with the extra street


make_extra_houses - command to build the extra households needed

households.txt - new houses to actually use.  We do this by filling up the zip codes
     first by the inbetween addresses, then by the extra block addresses.


elaborate_household - this is cool.  This finds the old street number from households.txt and matches it up
from thre it copies the person once per new household - and husband and wives will be duplicated. used to make 
unnamed_households.txt from households.txt and l006

unnamed_households.txt - households witht the prototype names and prototype id's referencing the older l006 ids.


husband_wife.txt - a list of husband wife id pairs based on l006 - this is used to marry later on.


OK at this point, we have unnamed_households.txt and we will have to process everything.  To do this,
we call 
...
